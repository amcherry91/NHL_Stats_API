# Scripts to get requests from the NHL API

This will be an on-going project to develop scripts which can be run to request data from the NHL API about teams, players, season data, results, and more. The scripts will eventually be able to request live game data as well as past data and information on upcoming matches.

## Guide

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the following libraries using the 'pip install' function of your command terminal or IDE;
```
import pandas as pd
import requests
```
3. Setup your IDE to run the scripts
4. Execute the scripts
5. Check the CSV files that are produced and clean them

## What data can you request from the API?

See [Tommy Andrews](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/blob/master/stats-api.md#teams) brilliant documentation to see all the data possibilities provided by the NHL API.

## Future Updates

This is an ongoing side project and will be updated regularly with new (and improved) scripts with the aim to eventually have a clean, lean, set of scripts that can be automated to pull data as required by the user.
